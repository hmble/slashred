WORK IN PROGRESS

NOTE: I created this project in order to learn Go. Currently I don't know
how to write test for third party API. That's why I don't have any test written
here.



To use package use following path `go get github.com/hmble/slashred`

Currently this library is unstable 

This library is heavily inspired by [PRAW](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw)
Also thanks to its maintainer [bboe](https://github.com/bboe) to help me out in
doubts about reddit api.
